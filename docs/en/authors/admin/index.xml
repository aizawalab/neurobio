      <title>New study on a novel microscope for 3D visualization of the brain structure with deep ultraviolet light</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deciphering the connectivity between brain regions is critical in understanding how the brain works. Three dimensional visualization of such networks of the neurons has been hampered by poor penetration of visible light into the large brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;duv.png&#34; alt=&#34;Deep UV light&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, our group combined the serial sectioning of the tissue block to expose new surface of the brain with scanning by light. Collected image would be used for three dimensional reconstruction of the brain structure later in the offiline analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.27.342345v1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Deep ultraviolet light based wide-field fluorescence microscope for brain imaging, preprint available in bioRxiv (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.27.342345)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since visible light excites the fluorescent label out of focus, which makes the image blurred, we applied light to a limited optical plane at the surface of the exposed tissue block. Deep ultraviolet (DUV) light loses its power quickly after it reaches at the plane within 10-20 µm from the surface so that the image consists of the emitted light coming from the plane in focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;schematics.png&#34; alt=&#34;Workflow in DUV imaging&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is combined with motorized optics which enables scanning wide field of view to image the large brain tissue for three dimensional reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;dii.png&#34; alt=&#34;Imaging neural pathways in the animals brain&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied this technique to the brain samples of small animals expressing green fluorescent protein and lipophilic dye in the neural pathways of mice and zebrafish. We are currently screening the fluorescent proteins and dyes compatible with this technology to widen the area for further application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, DUV imaging is quite cost-effective according to the simplicity of the optical setup. This is advantageous for the high throughput analyses with multple setups in the lab over the pre-existing expensive solution such as light-sheet and two-photon microscopies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sepsis Project</title>
      <link>https://neurobio.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/project/sepsis-project/</link>

      <guid>https://neurobio.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/project/sepsis-project/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a life-threatening dysfunction of multiple organs caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Notably, sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a diffuse brain dysfunction associated with sepsis. As SAE develops a wide variety of disorders in neural functions, ranging from delirium to long-term cognitive impairment, molecular mechanism underlying it remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convergent lines of evidence recently supported that physical and emotional stress induced inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. Microglia play a pivotal role in induction and expansion of the neuroinflammatory reactions. Activated microglia are known to secrete the signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines, which mediates the interplay between neurons and glia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin to understand a role of microglia in SAE by examining the function of mitochondrial protein, translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO). As it is upregulated in immune cells such as microglia, it has attracted a surge of interest as a biomarker of the inflammatory response in the CNS. Indeed, microglial activity seems to be under the regulation of TSPO, at least in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By extending those studies, we hope to develop a novel category of drugs for the treatment of SAE and stressor-related disorder which might occurs in intensive care survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;iba1_tspo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Activation of microglia with expression of TSPO&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Psychiatric sequelae of intensive care: a role of neuroinflammation</title>
      <link>https://neurobio.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/post/20200926/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 13:16:46 +0900</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Physical stress such as infection and trauma, often causes a variety of outcome. COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 would likely result in an increase in intensive care survivors who would frequently develop anxiety, depression and PTSD as a part of post intensive care syndrome (PICS). Survival rates for critically ill patients are increasing as medical science advances, but with it PICS in survivors is becoming a major medical problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convergent lines of evidence recently supported that physical and emotional stress induced inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. Microglia play a pivotal role in induction and expansion of the neuroinflammatory reactions. Activated microglia are known to secrete the signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines, which mediates the interplay between neurons and glia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a collaborative study with Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine in Hiroshima University, We have just published a review paper which discusses recent advances in the studies on the role of translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) in microglial activation and in stressor-related disorders associated with anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2020.104855&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[Link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tspo.png&#34; alt=&#34;neuroinflammation and TSPO&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies collectively support the view that upregulation of TSPO in microglia in response to the various physical and mental stress underlies pathophysiology of psychiatric symptoms. Future study may enable us to make use of TSPO as a probe to monitor the chronic time course of the stressor-related disorders in the survivors from the intensitve care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New publication on a novel gene causing depressive-like behaviors</title>
      <link>https://neurobio.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/post/20200918/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have just published a paper which identified a novel gene Pcsk5 acting on immune reaction in the mouse brain. Chronic stress activated this gene, which led to the subsequent activation of the other genes MMPs causing remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Since immune cell such as monocyte and microglia started to be activated and move more actively upon remodeling of extracellular matrix, Neurons seems to produce Pcsk5 seems to induce neuroinflammation in response to the chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-00843-0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Our publication in the Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/system/files/149927/20200916_pr01.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Press release from Hiroshima University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this protein turned out to be localize to the small area in the brain called habenula. This region attracts a surge of interest according to its role in regulation of central monoaminergic system. Monoamines such as dopamine and serotonin are known to be a basis of pathophysiology of depression and paharmacological action of antidepressant available currently. Since this area is excited when the animal perceives disappointment and punishment, it is proposed that the habenula may act as a negative source of reinforcement signal in the brain to control our behavioral strategy for survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Pcsk5.png&#34; alt=&#34;Chronic hyper-activation of the habenula via PCSK5-MMP ignaling pathway&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the current results into consideration, we may begin to understand how the transient activation of the habenula via punishment or disappointment can be chronic via changes in extracellular environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New publication on dopamine transmission in stress-coping behavior</title>
      <link>https://neurobio.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/post/20200829/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 17:47:48 +0900</pubDate>
      <guid>https://neurobio.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/post/20200829/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently published a paper on a role of neurotransmitter dopamine in stress-coping behavior in Journal of Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2020/08/26/JNEUROSCI.0444-20.2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Our publication in the Journal of Neurosience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the animals encounter the environmental threat as stressor, we can think of two distinct strategies to cope with it. One is to try to overcome it by exploring actively and be against it, the other is to avoid and refrain from being close to it passively. Active and passive coping of the stress would be the basis to determine the behavioral strategies upon exposure to the stressor. Since maladaptation to the stress predispose the psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, understanding the molecular mechanism underlying it is indispensable for the development of therapeutic intervention for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, we focused on neurotransmitter dopamine which plays pivotal roles in decision making and reinforcement of the behaviors. We developed a fine carbon fiber electrode to scan the brain region called nucleus accumbens to examine how the dopamine release change when the mice changed stress-coping behaviors under the inescapable stress such as tail suspension. We found that reduction of dopamine release in this area precede the initation of escape behavior, implicating the dopaminergic transmission to the decision making under the stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;fscv.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sub-milli second measurement of extracellular dopamine by fast scanning cyclic voltammetry&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check the causal effect of reduced dopamine release on mouse behaviors, we took two indepdent strategies. Optogenetic inhibitoin of dopaminergic fibers in the nucleus accumbens allowed inhibition of dopamine release at any time you want thru illumination of blue light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;optogenetics.png&#34; alt=&#34;Optogenetic manupulatin of the dopaminergic pathway&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tool we used this time is CRISPR/Cas9 which deletes the receptors for dopaminergic transmission efficiently in the mouse brain by way of viral vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;crispr.png&#34; alt=&#34;In vivo genome editing of dopaminergic receptors by CRISPR/Cas9 technology &#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both experiments proved that impaired dopaminergic transmission caused induction of escape behavior during tail suspension stress. Through this study, we are pleased to establish three important tools which must be useful for futre study: fast scanning cyclic voltammetry, optogenetics and CRISPR/Cas9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to discuss these new tools in the post comming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New publication on spreading depression implicated in migraine and stroke</title>
      <link>https://neurobio.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/post/20200626/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2020 12:40:12 +0900</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our group published a paper in the journal GLIA on a role of glutamate in spreading depression, a pre-clinical model for the aura preceding the migraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/glia.23874&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Our publication in GLIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/news/58665&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Press release from the Hiroshima University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreading depression is a propagating wave of neuronal and glial excitation under the pathological conditions. Studies suggested that it is found in the neurological disorders such as migraine and ischemic stroke. In particular, one third of migrainers are known to show neurological deficits (e.g., visual defect) in advance of the headache. Despite its clinical significance, molecular mechanism underlying the spreading depression reamins elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glutamate, an amino acid, acts as neurotransmitter in the brain. Upon binding of glutamate to the receptors, it modulates the flow of channel across the cell membrane of neurons to let it excited. This is how the glutamte facilitates the communication between neurons connecting with axonal fiber. If it acts too much with excessively high level in concentration in the extracellular space, it could be pathological and lead to the disorganized neural network activity and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that glutamate metabolism underlies the spreading depression. To address this, we examined the multiple knockout mice lacking any of the glutamate transporters, key modulators of the extracellular concentration of glutamate. Electrophysiological analｓysis revealed that mice lacking one of the glutamate transporters GLT-1 exhibited highest susceptibility to the spreading depression among mutant mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ephys.png&#34; alt=&#34;Electrophysiological analysis in the mutants&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address a role of GLT-1 in glutamate metabolism, we developed glutamate biosensor which measure the glutamate concentration 4 times in a second. Mice lacking GLT-1 exhibited accumulation of extracellular glutamate more quickly than control, suggesting that GLT-1 plays a critical role in clearing glutamate from the extracellular space to maintain the ambient condition there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;biosensor.png&#34; alt=&#34;Measurement of extracellular glutamate using biosensor&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these results indicate a drug enhancing GLT-1 function might be a candidate to treat the migrain by reducing the susceptibility to spreading depression. We hope to screen such drug using model animals soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Habenula is an evolutionarily conserved structure in the brain and regulates the central monoaminergic metabolism. Despite a surge of interest on the habenula in neuroscience, function of the human habenula remains unclear. Dr. Yoshino led the project members including our lab performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis during a contextual learning task.The left and right habenula were activated during aversive outcomes and the activation was associated with aversive prediction errors. Furthermore, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses demonstrated the left and right habenula to the left and right hippocampus connections during the presentation of contextual stimuli. These findings serve to highlight the neural mechanisms that may be relevant to understanding the broader relationship between the habenula and learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under the influence of COVID-19, we set out our histology class using online tools such as Microsoft Teams and BB9. With having a chat with undergraduate students over MS Teams, we hope to discuss cellular organization of the organs in human as before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New faculty from Germany</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We welcome new faculty from Germany. Dr. Handa and I worked previously in RIKEN Brain Science Institute in a collaborative way. While I moved to the new lab in Tokyo Medical and Dental University, he accomplished his work on a role of the rat prefrontal cortex in decision making as published in Cerebral Cortex (2017). Now that he elaborated his physiological technique using two photon microscopy, we look forward to collaborate with him again to make significant progress in Hiroshima.&lt;/p&gt;
