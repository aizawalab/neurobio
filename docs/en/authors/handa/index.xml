      <description>&lt;p&gt;We welcome new faculty from Germany. Dr. Handa and I worked previously in RIKEN Brain Science Institute in a collaborative way. While I moved to the new lab in Tokyo Medical and Dental University, he accomplished his work on a role of the rat prefrontal cortex in decision making as published in Cerebral Cortex (2017). Now that he elaborated his physiological technique using two photon microscopy, we look forward to collaborate with him again to make significant progress in Hiroshima.&lt;/p&gt;
