To reveal the neural pathway delineating the specific symptoms in diseases, genetics must be one of the most powerful tool to examine the neural network based on the speciific cell types and pathways. This can be achieved by a combination of gene targeting and viral vectors.\nOur lab developed such novel tools to target specific cell type such as glia for functional analyses. For example, we revealed a critical role of the astroglia in depressive-like behaviors and sleep disturbance by glia-specific viral vectors (Cui et al., J Neurosci, 2014).\nThis technology allows to target specific pathway embedded in the brain with help of a combination of optics and genetics (optogenetics). Indeed, we showed optogenetic inhibition of the dopaminergic pathway in the brain had antidepressant effect in mice (Cui et al., J Neurosci, 2020)\nWe are also successful in knocking out of the gene of our interest by combining the genome editing with viral vector. Specifically, it carries CRISPR/Cas9 cassette targeting the gene of our interest and target the brain regions, which enables the researcher to knock out the genes in any brain regions of the wildtype animals. This is how we could knock ou the gene without generating the knockout mouse line, which usually takes so long.

Sepsis is a life-threatening dysfunction of multiple organs caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Notably, sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a diffuse brain dysfunction associated with sepsis. As SAE develops a wide variety of disorders in neural functions, ranging from delirium to long-term cognitive impairment, molecular mechanism underlying it remains elusive.\nConvergent lines of evidence recently supported that physical and emotional stress induced inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. Microglia play a pivotal role in induction and expansion of the neuroinflammatory reactions. Activated microglia are known to secrete the signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines, which mediates the interplay between neurons and glia.\nWe begin to understand a role of microglia in SAE by examining the function of mitochondrial protein, translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO).

Associate with the systemic inflammation, not only the visceral organs but the brain starts to respond and behave in an unusual way. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a diffuse brain dysfunction associated with sepsis. The development of an effective strategy for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention is essential for the prevention of poor prognosis of SAE.\nTranslocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is a mitochondrial protein implicated in inflammatory responses. Despite accumulating evidence that implicates TSPO in the neuroinflammatory response of the central nervous system, the possible role of TSPO in SAE remains unclear. In the current study, we addressed a role of TSPO in neuroinflammation using mice 24 h after systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which consistently demonstrated microglial activation and behavioral inhibition.\nHiroshi Giga, Bin Ji, Kazuya Kikutani, Shuji Fukuda, Takashi Kitajima, Seishi Katsumata, Miho Matsumata, Tetsuya Suhara, Shigeto Yamawaki, Nobuaki Shime, Koji Hosokawa, Hidenori Aizawa \u0026ldquo;Pharmacological and Genetic Inhibition of Translocator Protein 18 kDa Ameliorated Neuroinflammation in Murine Endotoxemia Model\u0026rdquo; SHOCK (20) in press [PubMed] [Journal website]\nGene expression analysis showed that TSPO in the hippomcapus was induced following the systemic LPS injection, associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-1b. Interestingly, pretreatment with the TSPO antagonist, ONO-2952, or germ-line deletion of the TSPO gene exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect with significant suppression of LPS-induced production of those cytokines.\nThese effects of ONO-2952 or TSPO knockout were associated with significant recovery from behavioral inhibition, as shown by improved locomotor activity in the open field analysis. We also observed that ONO-2952 pretreatment suppressed the LPS-induced activation of TSPO-expressing microglia in the hippocampus.\nThis is how we began to understand a critical role of TSPO in SAE. Based on this finding, monitoring TSPO activity, as well as the progress of sepsis and its sequelae in the animal model, would deepen our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism of SAE.\n#Neurobiology #Hiroshima #Brain #神経 #広島 #脳\n","date":1608527191,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608527191,"objectID":"f4512a0fc261f2e9d1a6f78f74b821aa","permalink":"https://aizawalab.github.io/neurobio/en/post/20201221/","publishdate":"2020-12-21T14:06:31+09:00","relpermalink":"/neurobio/en/post/20201221/","section":"post","summary":"Pharmacological and genetic suppression of the mitochondrial protein rescues the sepsis-associated brain damage","tags":[],"title":"New gene acting on microglia activated upon sepsis which needs critical care medicine.","type":"post"},{"authors":["H.

Collected image would be used for three dimensional reconstruction of the brain structure later in the offiline analysis.\n Deep ultraviolet light based wide-field fluorescence microscope for brain imaging, preprint available in bioRxiv (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.27.342345)\nSince visible light excites the fluorescent label out of focus, which makes the image blurred, we applied light to a limited optical plane at the surface of the exposed tissue block. Deep ultraviolet (DUV) light loses its power quickly after it reaches at the plane within 10-20 µm from the surface so that the image consists of the emitted light coming from the plane in focus.\nThis is combined with motorized optics which enables scanning wide field of view to image the large brain tissue for three dimensional reconstruction.\nWe applied this technique to the brain samples of small animals expressing green fluorescent protein and lipophilic dye in the neural pathways of mice and zebrafish. We are currently screening the fluorescent proteins and dyes compatible with this technology to widen the area for further application.\nInterestingly, DUV imaging is quite cost-effective according to the simplicity of the optical setup.

One is to try to overcome it by exploring actively and be against it, the other is to avoid and refrain from being close to it passively. Active and passive coping of the stress would be the basis to determine the behavioral strategies upon exposure to the stressor. Since maladaptation to the stress predispose the psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, understanding the molecular mechanism underlying it is indispensable for the development of therapeutic intervention for them.\nTo address this, we focused on neurotransmitter dopamine which plays pivotal roles in decision making and reinforcement of the behaviors. We developed a fine carbon fiber electrode to scan the brain region called nucleus accumbens to examine how the dopamine release change when the mice changed stress-coping behaviors under the inescapable stress such as tail suspension. We found that reduction of dopamine release in this area precede the initation of escape behavior, implicating the dopaminergic transmission to the decision making under the stress.\nTo check the causal effect of reduced dopamine release on mouse behaviors, we took two indepdent strategies. Optogenetic inhibitoin of dopaminergic fibers in the nucleus accumbens allowed inhibition of dopamine release at any time you want thru illumination of blue light.\nAnother tool we used this time is CRISPR/Cas9 which deletes the receptors for dopaminergic transmission efficiently in the mouse brain by way of viral vector.\nBoth experiments proved that impaired dopaminergic transmission caused induction of escape behavior during tail suspension stress. Through this study, we are pleased to establish three important tools which must be useful for futre study: fast scanning cyclic voltammetry, optogenetics and CRISPR/Cas9.\nI hope to discuss these new tools in the post comming soon.\n#Neurobiology #Hiroshima #Brain #神経 #広島 #脳\n","date":1598604468,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598604468,"objectID":"112f2b2a4030132561f0a3c271ee7269","permalink":"https://aizawalab.github.io/neurobio/en/post/20200829/","publishdate":"2020-08-28T17:47:48+09:00","relpermalink":"/neurobio/en/post/20200829/","section":"post","summary":"Novel technology combining CRISPR/Cas9, optogenetics and voltammetry revealed a role of dopamine in depressive-like behaviors.","tags":[],"title":"New publication on dopamine transmission in stress-coping behavior","type":"post"},{"authors":["W.

Studies suggested that it is found in the neurological disorders such as migraine and ischemic stroke. In particular, one third of migrainers are known to show neurological deficits (e.g., visual defect) in advance of the headache. Despite its clinical significance, molecular mechanism underlying the spreading depression reamins elusive.\nGlutamate, an amino acid, acts as neurotransmitter in the brain. Upon binding of glutamate to the receptors, it modulates the flow of channel across the cell membrane of neurons to let it excited. This is how the glutamte facilitates the communication between neurons connecting with axonal fiber. If it acts too much with excessively high level in concentration in the extracellular space, it could be pathological and lead to the disorganized neural network activity and cell death.\nWe hypothesize that glutamate metabolism underlies the spreading depression. To address this, we examined the multiple knockout mice lacking any of the glutamate transporters, key modulators of the extracellular concentration of glutamate. Electrophysiological analｓysis revealed that mice lacking one of the glutamate transporters GLT-1 exhibited highest susceptibility to the spreading depression among mutant mice.\nTo address a role of GLT-1 in glutamate metabolism, we developed glutamate biosensor which measure the glutamate concentration 4 times in a second. Mice lacking GLT-1 exhibited accumulation of extracellular glutamate more quickly than control, suggesting that GLT-1 plays a critical role in clearing glutamate from the extracellular space to maintain the ambient condition there.\nCollectively, these results indicate a drug enhancing GLT-1 function might be a candidate to treat the migrain by reducing the susceptibility to spreading depression. We hope to screen such drug using model animals soon.\n#Neurobiology #Hiroshima #Brain #神経 #広島 #脳\n","date":1593142812,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593142812,"objectID":"d641f71aa3a81bd13f77da863670c459","permalink":"https://aizawalab.github.io/neurobio/en/post/20200626/","publishdate":"2020-06-26T12:40:12+09:00","relpermalink":"/neurobio/en/post/20200626/","section":"post","summary":"We recently publish a paper on a role of glutamate metabolism in modulation of spreading depression which has been reported in the brain with neurological disorders such as migraine.","tags":[],"title":"New publication on spreading depression implicated in migraine and stroke","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hidenori Aizawa","Meina Zhu"],"categories":[],"content":"We welcome the international students and collaboration to facilitate our progress in neuroscience.
