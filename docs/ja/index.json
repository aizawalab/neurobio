et al., J Neurosci, 2014）。\nまた、最近ではこのような手綱核の活性化に嫌な出来事や失望体験がどのように関わるかを調べています。特に神経細胞の働きを左右する細胞外環境を形成するグリア細胞の役割に注目しています。実際、慢性ストレスによりうつ病のような行動を示すマウスの手綱核を調べたところ、サイトカインと呼ばれる液性因子が多く産生されていて、炎症性細胞が多く動員されていました。その分子的背景を調べると、Pcsk5という細胞外基質の再編成に関与する遺伝子の発現が増えていました。この遺伝子の働きを抑えるとうつ病のような行動が起きにくくなることも明らかとなり、ストレスが動物行動を制御する手がかりをつかみつつあります。\n

脳の主な興奮性の神経連絡はグルタミン酸を介して行われています。しかし、シナプスなどの細胞外のグルタミン酸濃度が過剰になるとむしろ細胞に対して毒性を発揮します。このような過剰な興奮は波状に伝搬し、「Killer wave」などと呼ばれ片頭痛や脳梗塞を増悪させる要因になることがわかってきました。\n 広島大学プレスリリース：片頭痛の前兆に関与する遺伝子をマウスで発見～片頭痛の病態解明や新たな治療薬の開発に前進～\n特に、虚血や低血糖などのストレス下では大脳皮質の興奮性はむしろ高まり、場合によってはその興奮の高まりが波のように三次元的に広がっていく拡延性抑制（もしくは拡延性脱分極）という現象が急激に注目を集めています。\n実際、最近の多くのヒト機能画像研究が片頭痛や脳卒中・脳外傷の患者の大脳皮質で拡延性抑制を観察したと報告しています。さらに悪い事に拡延性抑制は繰り返し引き起こされ、例えば脳外傷では拡延性抑制が繰り返されるほど予後が不良になる傾向があるようです。\nこれは、おそらく拡延性抑制により大脳皮質細胞が必要とするエネルギー需要と虚血や低血糖などにより減少したエネルギー供給のミスマッチにより細胞死を起こす領域が拡大するためと考えられます。このような状況を改善するためには、拡延性抑制を抑える新たな治療法の確立が急務です。\nこの問題に挑戦するため、マウスやゼブラフィッシュをモデルとして研究を進めています。\n＜研究成果１＞　グリア細胞の一種アストロサイトが拡延性抑制への感受性を制御していることを明らかにしました。通常、アストロサイトは細胞外のグルタミン酸を細胞内へ輸送体を使って運び込むことにより細胞外グルタミン酸濃度を低濃度に抑えています。我々が最近開発したグルタミン酸輸送体GLT-1のノックアウトマウスは大脳皮質の興奮性が病的に高まり、拡延性抑制に対する感受性が低くなっていました。グリア細胞のグルタミン酸輸送能を高める治療法を開発する事で拡延性抑制の頻度を抑え、ひいては頭痛の予防や脳卒中の予後改善につながる可能性を示唆しています。\n＜研究成果２＞　薬剤スクリーニングに適したモデル動物ゼブラフィッシュの脳で拡延性抑制を再現することに成功しました。このことで、神経活動を指標として拡延性抑制を抑える候補薬を調べていきます。\n","date":1586908800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ja","lastmod":1586908800,"objectID":"85e41b12cca7db6d0e612abb90e53e25","permalink":"https://aizawalab.github.io/neurobio/ja/project/spreading_depression-project/","publishdate":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/neurobio/ja/project/spreading_depression-project/","section":"project","summary":"損傷された脳では何が起こっているのか？じわじわ広がる「キラー・ウェーブ」とは?","tags":["Neurology"],"title":"脳卒中・片頭痛の増悪を招く興奮性の波","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"てんかんに対する伝統医学治療の生物学的実証

脳は機能の異なった複数の領域から構成されており、これらが相互作用することによって働いています。うつ病のような精神疾患は多彩な症状を示す症候群で、それぞれの症状に対応する神経回路の病理を明らかにすることが、新しい診断法・治療法の開発には不可欠です。この問題に取り組むため、遺伝子改変技術とウイルスによる遺伝子導入技術の開発を進めています。\n例えば、新規遺伝子導入技術によってうつ病様の行動異常や睡眠障害に関与する脳の新たな細胞を見出しています。具体的には、神経細胞の活動を制御するグリア細胞のうち、アストロサイトと呼ばれる細胞の機能を抑制したマウスを作成し、ストレス感受性や不安様行動、レム睡眠異常などのうつ病様表現型を示すことを明らかにしました（Cui et al., J Neurosci, 2014; Aizawa and Zhu; 2019; Aizawa et al., GLIA, 2020)。\nまた、光遺伝学という新規技術を使うと、脳に埋め込まれた特定の神経回路だけを選択的に操作することができます。実際、この方法をドーパミン神経細胞に応用することで、マウスの抗うつ効果を引き起こす事ができました (Cui et al., J Neurosci, 2020)。\nさらに、最近ではCRISPR/Cas9によるゲノム編集技術をウイルス遺伝子導入法と組み合わせて、遺伝子改変の効率化を実現しました。これまでは、トランスジェニックマウス系統やノックアウトマウス系統を作成するには長い時間と膨大なコストがかかっていました。新規開発技術では、野生型マウスに対して開発したウイルスを導入することでこの問題を解決します（Cui et al., J Neurosci, 2020）。この遺伝子導入をはかるウイルス作成には１ヶ月程度しかかからないことから、効率の面で飛躍的な進歩が期待できます（Aida et al., BMC Genomics, 2016）。また、この技術応用によりヒト精神・神経疾患で見つかった遺伝子変異が、脳の活動にどのような影響を及ぼすかを調べることができるようになりました（Ishizu et al., Hum Mol Genet, 2016; Aikawa et al., Hum Mol Genet, 2017）。\n関連論文\nCui W, Aida T, Ito H, Kobayashi K, Wada Y, Kato S, Nakano T, Zhu M, Isa K, Kobayashi K, Isa T, Tanaka K, Aizawa H.

One is to try to overcome it by exploring actively and be against it, the other is to avoid and refrain from being close to it passively. Active and passive coping of the stress would be the basis to determine the behavioral strategies upon exposure to the stressor. Since maladaptation to the stress predispose the psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, understanding the molecular mechanism underlying it is indispensable for the development of therapeutic intervention for them.\nTo address this, we focused on neurotransmitter dopamine which plays pivotal roles in decision making and reinforcement of the behaviors. We developed a fine carbon fiber electrode to scan the brain region called nucleus accumbens to examine how the dopamine release change when the mice changed stress-coping behaviors under the inescapable stress such as tail suspension. We found that reduction of dopamine release in this area precede the initation of escape behavior, implicating the dopaminergic transmission to the decision making under the stress.\nTo check the causal effect of reduced dopamine release on mouse behaviors, we took two indepdent strategies. Optogenetic inhibitoin of dopaminergic fibers in the nucleus accumbens allowed inhibition of dopamine release at any time you want thru illumination of blue light.\nAnother tool we used this time is CRISPR/Cas9 which deletes the receptors for dopaminergic transmission efficiently in the mouse brain by way of viral vector.\nBoth experiments proved that impaired dopaminergic transmission caused induction of escape behavior during tail suspension stress. Through this study, we are pleased to establish three important tools which must be useful for futre study: fast scanning cyclic voltammetry, optogenetics and CRISPR/Cas9.\nI hope to discuss these new tools in the post comming soon.\n#Neurobiology #Hiroshima #Brain #神経 #広島 #脳\n","date":1598604468,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ja","lastmod":1598604468,"objectID":"112f2b2a4030132561f0a3c271ee7269","permalink":"https://aizawalab.github.io/neurobio/ja/post/20200829/","publishdate":"2020-08-28T17:47:48+09:00","relpermalink":"/neurobio/ja/post/20200829/","section":"post","summary":"Novel technology combining CRISPR/Cas9, optogenetics and voltammetry revealed a role of dopamine in depressive-like behaviors.","tags":[],"title":"New publication on dopamine transmission in stress-coping behavior","type":"post"},{"authors":["W.

Studies suggested that it is found in the neurological disorders such as migraine and ischemic stroke. In particular, one third of migrainers are known to show neurological deficits (e.g., visual defect) in advance of the headache. Despite its clinical significance, molecular mechanism underlying the spreading depression reamins elusive.\nGlutamate, an amino acid, acts as neurotransmitter in the brain. Upon binding of glutamate to the receptors, it modulates the flow of channel across the cell membrane of neurons to let it excited. This is how the glutamte facilitates the communication between neurons connecting with axonal fiber. If it acts too much with excessively high level in concentration in the extracellular space, it could be pathological and lead to the disorganized neural network activity and cell death.\nWe hypothesize that glutamate metabolism underlies the spreading depression. To address this, we examined the multiple knockout mice lacking any of the glutamate transporters, key modulators of the extracellular concentration of glutamate. Electrophysiological analｓysis revealed that mice lacking one of the glutamate transporters GLT-1 exhibited highest susceptibility to the spreading depression among mutant mice.\nTo address a role of GLT-1 in glutamate metabolism, we developed glutamate biosensor which measure the glutamate concentration 4 times in a second. Mice lacking GLT-1 exhibited accumulation of extracellular glutamate more quickly than control, suggesting that GLT-1 plays a critical role in clearing glutamate from the extracellular space to maintain the ambient condition there.\nCollectively, these results indicate a drug enhancing GLT-1 function might be a candidate to treat the migrain by reducing the susceptibility to spreading depression. We hope to screen such drug using model animals soon.\n#Neurobiology #Hiroshima #Brain #神経 #広島 #脳\n","date":1593142812,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ja","lastmod":1593142812,"objectID":"d641f71aa3a81bd13f77da863670c459","permalink":"https://aizawalab.github.io/neurobio/ja/post/20200626/","publishdate":"2020-06-26T12:40:12+09:00","relpermalink":"/neurobio/ja/post/20200626/","section":"post","summary":"We recently publish a paper on a role of glutamate metabolism in modulation of spreading depression which has been reported in the brain with neurological disorders such as migraine.","tags":[],"title":"New publication on spreading depression implicated in migraine and stroke","type":"post"},{"authors":["相澤　秀紀"],"categories":[],"content":"We welcome the international students and collaboration to facilitate our progress in neuroscience.

For example, we have invited the researcher from US, UK and China to discuss and perform experiments together to develop new technologies in neuroscience.\nAs an international and research university, Hiroshima university helps the students and researcher who do not speak Japanese to learn Japanese and Japanese culture through specific classes and socials (international luncheon parties).\n Contact us if you are interested in joining us!\n#Neurobiology #Hiroshima #Brain #神経 #広島 #脳\n","date":1591995871,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ja","lastmod":1591995871,"objectID":"e5eeeb682a918aabc0fc96cf4f6a6f37","permalink":"https://aizawalab.github.io/neurobio/ja/post/20200613/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T06:04:31+09:00","relpermalink":"/neurobio/ja/post/20200613/","section":"post","summary":"With the international background in Hiroshima University, our lab encourages the students and researcher to develop their careers by scholarship and grants.
