We wrote a review paper in Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience on a role of the habenula in depressioin. This is a recent update of the small brain structure called habenula in modulation of the mood in our daily life by graduate student Zhu-san and me. We are happy to hear that our paper turned out to be one of the most downloaded paper in the journal during 2018-2019.
