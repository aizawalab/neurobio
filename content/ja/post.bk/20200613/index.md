We welcome the international students and collaboration to facilitate our progress in neuroscience. With the international background in Hiroshima, our lab encourages the students and researcher to develop their careers by scholarship and grants. Indeed, our lab members from a variety of countries all over the world weekly hold the meeting for the progress report and journal club. We also discuss the textbook to help the international students to understand the basics in neuroscience, optics and data science periodically.

On the other hand, our research is enpowered by collaborations with researcher all over the world. For example, we have invited the researcher from US, UK and China to discuss and perform experiments together to develop new technologies in neuroscience. 

As an international and research university, Hiroshima university helps the students and researcher who do not speak Japanese to learn Japanese and Japanese culture through specific classes and socials (international luncheon parties).
