# Microscopic analysis of the neural structure
Brain consists of multiple brain regions with different functions. Since they interact to act as unified organ, visualization of the three dimensional organization of the gene/protein expression on neural circuits is indispensable. To address this, we are currently developing a novel fluorescent microscope which allows volumentric analysis of the nervous tissue with referring to the gene/protein expression.
